Design Notes
* Store copy of keys/words in both GPU/CPU
 * CPU handles race conditions & all that, GPU can search faster
* Speedup by removing synchronization in insertion
* Colocate keys/words on GPU for better cache performance, push the system over the CPU implementation in terms of performance
* [CONFIRM] Some difference can be observed by making sure (1 + KEY_SIZE + WORD_SIZE == 16 OR 32)
* using prefetchasync before find helps speedup find
